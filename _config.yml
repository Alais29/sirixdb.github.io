    Sirix facilitates effective and efficient storing and querying of your temporal data through snapshotting and a novel versioning approach called sliding snapshot. Currently we support the storage and querying of XML-documents in our binary format through a RESTful-API, an XQuery-API and a low-level, transactional, cursor based API (also for JSON).
