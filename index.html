					<h2>Sirix is an evolutionary <strong>temporal</strong> NoSQL storage sytem at its heart, which efficiently stores the history of your data.
					<br />
					We store per revision and per page changes.</h2>
					<p>Sirix is especially well suited for flash drives as for instance SSDs due to its log structured <strong>copy-on-write</strong> nature.
					<br />
					We allow <strong>time-travel</strong> queries for your <strong>XML</strong> as well as <strong>JSON</strong> data and store both in our binary on-disk structure or a lightweight in-memory structure.

										<h3>Versioning done right</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We are versioning data as well as index-structures on a per revision and per record/node level. As such versioning takes place at a fine-granular level. Furthermore through a novel versioning algorithm called <em>sliding snapshot</em> we are able to avoid write- and read-peaks.</p>

										<h3>REST</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We built an asynchronous, RESTful API, which is non-blocking with <a href="https://vertx.io">Vert.x</a>, <a href="https://kotlinlang.org">Kotlin</a> (especially coroutines are very powerful) and <a href="https://www.keycloak.org">Keycloak</a> for authorization.</p>

										<h3>XQuery / JSONiq</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Several extensions to an XQuery-processor called <a href="http://brackit.org">Brackit</a> are available. We for instance support navigation via novel temporal XPath axis not only in space but also in time. Furthermore, several additional precompiled functions are available to simplify the analysis of your temporal data. The API also provides a very convenient way to interact with Sirix. Think of it as an in-memory representation of a DOM.</p>

										<h3>Transactional cursor API</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Our low-level, transactional, cursor based API is very powerful. We not only provide standard XPath axis and additionally temporal enhancements to navigate in time, but also several other axis as for instance a LevelOrder axis, a PostorderAxis, a DescendantAxis which can skip whole subtrees. Furthermore, we provide several filters and much more.</p>

										<h3>Diffing-API</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We provide a way to currently import several revisions of an XML-document with the help of a diffing-algorithm called Fast Matching Simple EditScript. With the help of this diff-algorithm we are able to import not the whole changed second, third and so on version of the document but only the encountered differences between any two versions.</p>
<p>Once we have stored several revisions in Sirix, either through the import diff-algorithm or simply through working with Sirix in the first place we are able to quickly compute diffs between any two revisions because of our stable node identifiers and optionally stored hashes (each time two hashes are equal, the whole subtree can be skipped).</p>
